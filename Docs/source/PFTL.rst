Python for the Lab
==================
This is the documentation of the code itself, sometimes called the "API Reference".

It is automatically generated from the docstrings in the different files, which means it doesn't need to be updated separately. The only requirement is to update the references.

For example, if a new module is added or if a class changes its name, we need to find the file within the `Docs` folder that references it (or create a new one if it does not exist) and update it.
